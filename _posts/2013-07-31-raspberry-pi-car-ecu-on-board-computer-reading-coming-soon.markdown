I have recently bought a lotus Elise and I've been wanting to monitor some of the sensors that are available through the on board computer. 

Luckily this is going to be pretty easy and I am just awaiting my obc reader to arrive from eBay.Â  Once it's here I'll do a full write up on how to get this running on your pi too!

Stay tuned... I'm going to throw in some bluetooth connection info also.

Here are some pics!
