Raspberrypi.org has just featured a great article about a hosting company that has set up a free raspberry pi colocation service.  There are two options, either buy a pi from them and have it racked or send over your own pi and they will sort everything else out for you. 

This is a great service if you want to run your own web server and headless setup. They will pay for all of the electricity, bandwidth and you get a huge upload and download. 

To take a look please go to their site:
