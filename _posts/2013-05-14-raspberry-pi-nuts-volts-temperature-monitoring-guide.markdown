In Mays Nuts & Volts there is a great article outlining temperature monitoring on the Raspberry Pi from component buying through to coding in python to get the monitors up and running. I want to preserve such a great article for all to find as the graphics coupled with the detailed explanations could really help out those of us looking for a new project or anyone who runs a code club and wishes to take their students to the next level of automation and development. The article link can be found [here](http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nutsvolts201305-rPi_temp_monitoring.pdf).

I would like to thank the write Benjamin Kibalo for an excellent article.
