I am going to start by creating a simple home temperature monitor. I have found a cool looking site called [Device Hive](http://www.devicehive.com/) which is going to be tested. I have seen plenty of tutorials about coding the logging myself but for now I am not too interested.. I do plenty of coding at work I want to have a good go at using other peoples api's for my initial projects after all it claims to make "device connectivity easy" ;)
