In the quest to find a well optimised server set up for hosting my blog I have moved from Apache to lighttpd in the past. I am now on the lookout again for something light weight and optimised for the Pi. It looks as though things have moved on since my initial review and I have just stumbled upon [Monkey HTTP Daemon](http://monkey-project.com/).




> Monkey is a lightweight and powerful web server and development ostack for GNU/Linux.

It has been designed to be very scalable with low memory and CPU consumption, the perfect solution for embedded devices. Made for ARM, x86 and x64.




It looks as though Monkey has been around for a while but I just missed it however they have an excellent tutorial on getting the server up and running on the Raspberry Pi. [I won't reword and blog about how to do the installation but I will link you directly to it.](http://monkey-project.com/raspberry/)

For anyone who has used Monkey before please leave a comment in relation to its performance on the Raspberry Pi. I am especially interested in anyone who can directly compare its performance to the other typical servers used such as Apache, Nginx and Lighttpd.
