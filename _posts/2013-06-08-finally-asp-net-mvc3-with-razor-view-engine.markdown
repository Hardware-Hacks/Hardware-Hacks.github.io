So after two weeks of ironing out all possible bugs that the Pi could throw at me and all of the issues with running mono I have a page up and running with the standard MVC 3 Template. I will be soon posting up a tutorial on how to get this fully up and running including the fact you need to be running soft float vs hard float.

But for now here is the link to view the template up and running using my 2nd Pi to host: [http://82.46.242.96:81/mono/](http://82.46.242.96:81/mono/)

Also now running twitter bootstrap! [http://82.46.242.96:81/Project2/]( http://82.46.242.96:81/Project2/) (May require a page refresh as to get it looking right as I have broken the server caching =p )
