Thought I would just link you all to a great tutorial using your current pc/laptop setup with an ethernet cable to be able to connect your display/keyboard/mouse to your raspberry pi so you do not have to go through the trouble of using a HDMI cable and seperate peripherals.

The article can be found [here](http://pihw.wordpress.com/guides/direct-network-connection/).
