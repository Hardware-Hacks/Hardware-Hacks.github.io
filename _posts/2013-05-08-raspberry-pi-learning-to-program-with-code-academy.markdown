Interested in learning a coding language such as python or java that can be used on your raspberry pi? Well I would like to share with you a great resource for learning new code languages or brush up on your current knowledge. [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/) allows you for FREE to learn a new language online with real examples and an IDE that you can use to test code yourself.

If you want to build a new project, get involved in their community or just build up a profile to show off your knowledge of coding languages I highly recommend going to the site to take a look around and even sign up. For those of us that are looking to start up a [Code Club](http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/index.php/2013/04/23/raspberry-pi-code-club/) but do not feel as though they have enough programming knowledge this is definitely a great place to start. I am pretty handy with a few languages but I had never tried python, little did I know the Raspberry Pi is ideal for python coding especially when you want full support and low resource usage. By using Code Academy I have started to get my head around the syntax differences and some other cool features of python. It is always easy to learn by example and even better learning by actually doing. Code Academy fulfills both of these options but also offers another option.. TO TEACH.

The teaching element of Code Academy allows you to create courses, share your knowledge and build up a reputation that will also be linked to your programming profile. This is an ideal place to get material collected together or see what others have produced that you can then use to teach your classes, clubs or even yourself.

Below I list a couple of direct links to some of the languages you can begin to learn and execute on your Raspberry Pi:
