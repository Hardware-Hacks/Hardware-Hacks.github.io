So tonight has involved utilising some of ownclouds extra functionality. I have set up Ampache on my raspberry the website to view exactly what this is can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampache).

Essentially ampache allows you to stream your music from various storage devices either remotely or localy. I know owncloud has its own music area but lets face it there is still a lot of work to be done and to be honest when you get over 2k songs in the list it can get a little slugish. Ampache has a number of phone and tablet apps which means you can stream your music directly when out and about but also create your own playlists, sample some random selections and download/add/update tracks on the go.

I have found a great installation guide which I recommend using over the usual apt-get install ampache. I had a few issues using apt-get so reverted back to the trusty tar and manual installation which went as smooth as a babys behind.

The step by step guide can be found [here](http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=12283.msg116699#msg116699). I used the second half of the guide which is concerned with the ampache downloads etc onwards.

I recommend giving this mini project a go it is well worth the 20 minutes to get up and running and as I have said it will plug in directly to your owncloud so you can use your tracks which are already available!
