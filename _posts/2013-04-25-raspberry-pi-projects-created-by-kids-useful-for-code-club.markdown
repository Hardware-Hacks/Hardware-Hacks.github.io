As a big believer in our young adults being given access to code and hardware hacking such as can be done on the raspberry pi I am often on the look out for projects that have been produced either by children or for children. There is a great post over at techradar discussing [8 great Raspberry Pi projects created by kids](http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/8-great-raspberry-pi-projects-created-by-kids-1143243). Please take some time out to go and take a look. Hopefully this will inspire you to look for other projects or incorporate these in to your [code club](http://www.codeclub.org.uk/).
