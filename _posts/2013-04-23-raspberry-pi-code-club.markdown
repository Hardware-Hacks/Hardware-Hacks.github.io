Here is a very interesting quote by Eben Upton who is a co-founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation:



> The 80s saw an ecosystem of microcomputers go away and become replaced by games consoles and PCs -- and at the same time, we saw a reduction in the number of kids participating in programming and computer engineering. We're already in a bad place, and if we're not careful, it could get even worse.


 
How do we fix such a problem? well to be honest it is quite easy in theory, you need to realise that the earlier you can bring in the skills of electronics, coding & computer sciences in to the lives of our youngest members of society the more advanced their knowledge will be by the time they reach a working age. There is nothing to say that children are not capable of producing the next leap forward in technology. However without teaching them the necessary skills to do this we will find that all of that potential is left locked up.



> I'm concerned that we're very happy to see computers increasingly becoming appliances in sealed boxes -- systems that you can only use to consume, not produce.



So how can we educate earlier? Do we need to re-vamp the whole of the IT curriculum in secondary education? Do we need to extend our computer science degrees to include more content? Do we need to use more IPads within the class room? 

Whilst all of the above may have potential there is nothing more powerful than taking a model we know that already works and re-applying it to our current scenario. We all remember those experiments in chemistry that went wrong, we all remember those physics lessons where we actually got up and did something, we all remember building small projects in design and craft lessons.. but why? Because we were actually engaged in doing something, less theory more practical and being taught by adults who also took enjoyment in teaching these lessons.

The answer is here already. Let me introduce you to [Code Club](http://www.codeclub.org.uk/).



> Code Club is about fun, creativity and learning through exploring. It’s important that the children enjoy their time at Code Club and that it doesn’t feel like another school lesson. They should understand that they’re in charge of the computer, and can (and should) make it do what they want, not the other way around.



Code club pushes all of the right buttons as I have just mentioned. Engage children and allow knowledgeable adults to teach in a practical way. Professionals, Hobbyists, Parents and other young adults all coming together as a community to teach our primary school children early enough that their potential can be unlocked so much sooner than our current education system allows.



> Our projects are written by programmers then tested with children at 20 pilot schools across the country. We ask them to rate our projects and they told us they are 92% fun! When we're testing we look for air punches and fist bumps. That means they like them!



Use the knowledge you are gaining with your Raspberry Pi, the knowledge you may have from your personal projects or place of work and start to pass this on to our future. I have heard it time and time again "If only I had learn't how to do this sooner.." every coder wishes they had started learning sooner and we all feel as though we have never reached the end of our learning, so lets give children and young adults that head start! Please take a look at the code club website and see what you can do to help.
