Now  I know this blog is purely aimed at the Pi but I thought it would be worth showing some other projects going on out there. We all know about the Arduino, Beagle Boards etc but a more powerful version of all of these has been running on KickStarter. It is called "Parallela". Below is a brief overview of the specifications:

[![parallella_gige](http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/parallella_gige-150x150.jpg)](http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/parallella_gige.jpg)



> The following list shows the major components planned for the Parallella computer:

Zynq-7010 Dual-core ARM A9 CPU
Epiphany Multicore Accelerator (16 or 64 cores)
1GB RAM 
MicroSD Card
USB 2.0 (two) 
Two general purpose expansion connectors
Ethernet 10/100/1000
HDMI connection
Ships with Ubuntu OS
Ships with free open source Epiphany development tools that include C compiler, multicore debugger, Eclipse IDE, OpenCL SDK/compiler, and run time libraries. 
Dimensions are 3.4'' x 2.1''  
Once completed, the 64-core version of the Parallella computer would deliver over 90 GFLOPS of performance and would have the the horse power comparable to a theoretical 45 GHz CPU [64 CPU cores * 700MHz] on a board the size of a credit card while consuming only 5 Watts under typical work loads



So as we can see the main selling point to this is the CPU. 64 cores?! Quite impressive but would we be able to put these to good use and see the benefits of multiprocessing. For now I will sit on the fence but as always it is good to see technology pushing on and alternatives being produced.

Here are some interesting links to the project:
