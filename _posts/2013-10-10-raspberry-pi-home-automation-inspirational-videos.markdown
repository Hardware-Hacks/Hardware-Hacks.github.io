I've been staring at my second Raspberry Pi sat beside my TV running XBMC for a few weeks and I've decided it needs to be doing more. I've always liked the idea of home automation, lights turning on/off, control of heating and the like. So I decided to hunt for inspiration and it led me to the following cool Youtube videos. Well worth watching if you have some time and its good to get the perspective of how others have tackled the same sort of projects.

**1. Not related to the Pi or Arduino but great for ideas!**

**2. Controlling lights and switches with node.js**

**3. Crazy music.. but good use of phone!**

**4. I like the idea of testing a setup in this way with simple LEDs**

**5. Controlling GPIO pins remotely! With installation instructions very useful!**

I hope some of the above offer some good ideas for you too. I think I'm off to buy some hardware!
