So you want to run your raspberry pi from batteries, put it to sleep, wake it at intervals, give it some outside interrupts and all of that other cool stuff but the Pi is an "always on" bit of hardware. Even when it is shutdown the little power led will still be there.

Well thanks to the awesome work at [Spell Foundry](http://spellfoundry.com/) there are now ways to accomplish all of the above and more. I am currently beta testing one of the boards to iron out any of the bugs and get everything mass public ready so please show some support and why not follow [Spell Foundry on twitter @SpellFoundry ](https://twitter.com/SpellFoundry/)and take a look around their site.
