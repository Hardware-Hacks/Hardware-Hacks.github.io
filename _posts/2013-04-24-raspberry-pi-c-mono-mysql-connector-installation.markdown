Linking with my [previous post](http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/index.php/2013/04/22/raspberry-pi-c-mono-hello-world-setup-installation-compile-gmcs-execution/) I want to talk about utilising c# mono and the mysql connector in order to allow our raspberry pi to connect to a local instance of a mysql database. This is useful is you prefer using asp.net and c# over python and you want to now start to build upon my last tutorial and create/read/update/delete (CRUD) data using your c# console application.

We will assume you have mono and c# up and running including the compiler gmcs and you are now just looking to connect to your database and read some data. Â I initially wanted to test this as I want to read data from a temperature sensor on a breadboard and push the data in to a mysql database. I will then be able to read this data and output it to one of my webpages giving a live graphical view of the current temperature in the room where my pi is installed. The potential to produce projects such as these are never ending and being able to do this in a language such as c# and not just python/java etc opens even more doors to those who are used to using the language already or want to start learning.

First off in order to allow c# to connect to mysql databases you need to get a copy of the mysql connector. It can be found [here](http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-Net/mysql-connector-net-5.2.3-noinstall.zip)

You need to unzip this and find the file called **MySql.Data.dll** then place it on to your pi in a folder where you can get to it easy. I downloaded it through my phone as wget kept on producing a 404 error for some reason. I then connected to my raspberry pi's shared usb hard drive and placed the file there.

We will now register the MySql Data Connerctor file using the gacutil.


    
    
    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo gacutil -i /media/usbhdd/MySql.Data.dll
    Installed /media/usbhdd/MySql.Data.dll into the gac (/usr/lib/mono/gac)
    



As a check you can see what is inside the mono/gac however be warned you will get a huge list.. I have tried to point to the Mysql.Data entry below >>>> <<<<<.

    
    
    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo ls -a /usr/lib/mono/gac

Now we know the registration has been successful we can build upon my last tutorial where we created a simple c# console application to print out a few lines of text.

Lets navigate to the director we created last time, if you do not have this then simply use mkdir and re-create the folders.


    
    
    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ cd /home/pi/Projects/HelloWorld
    pi@raspberrypi ~/Projects/HelloWorld $ ls -a
    . .. HelloWorld.cs HelloWorld.exe
    



You can see the two hello world files from last time, we will now create a new file called MySql that will be used to connect to the MySql database.


    
    
    pi@raspberrypi ~/Projects/HelloWorld $ sudo nano MySql.cs
    



The contents of this file can be copied and pasted as per below. But essentially this code will use the mysql connector client to connect to our mysql database and query it for its version number. This is very basic but it will give you an idea of basic READ functionality.


    
    
    using System;
    using MySql.Data.MySqlClient;
    
    public class Connecting_Example
    {
    
        static void Main()
        {
            string cs = @"server=localhost;userid=testuser;
                password=******;database=TestDB";
    
            MySqlConnection conn = null;
    
            try
            {
              conn = new MySqlConnection(cs);
              conn.Open();
              Console.WriteLine("MySQL version : {0}", conn.ServerVersion);
    
            } catch (MySqlException ex)
            {
              Console.WriteLine("Error: {0}",  ex.ToString());
    
            } finally
            {
              if (conn != null)
              {
                  conn.Close();
              }
            }
        }
    }
    
    



You will need to alter the lines:

    
    
     string cs = @"server=localhost;userid=testuser;
                password=******;database=TestDB";
    



I simply created a new database and added a user to it for testing. You can connect directly to a pre-existing database if you wish with the same username and password used to access it. If anyone is interested in how to set up mysql databases, users and new databases then let me know and it can be our next tutorial ;).

Now comes the hard part, which is often left unmentioned in other tutorials. Even though you have registered MySql.Data within mono you can sometimes get the issue where the c# file does not recognise the MySql.Data declaration as it has not been added as a reference.

To fix this issue we can pass a -r  in to our gmcs command during the compiling of the application.


    
    
    pi@raspberrypi ~/Projects/HelloWorld $ sudo gmcs -r /usr/lib/mono/gac/MySql.Data/5.2.3.0__c5687fc88969c44d/MySql.Data.dll MySql.cs
    



The pathway entered above is the default for the MySql.Connector plugin I linked to earlier. If you end up using an earlier or later version you will be able to find the path by running "ls -a /usr/lib/mono/gac/MySql.Data/" this will give you the version folder so you can hit the MySql.Data.Dll.

Now the referencing has been done we will have a MySql.exe file sat ready to run. We will now use mono to execute this file and hopefully output our mysql version.


    
    
    pi@raspberrypi ~/Projects/HelloWorld $ mono MySql.exe
    MySQL version : 5.5.30-1.1
    



There we have it, a console application that connects to our mysql database and checks for the version number, outputting it back to us at the end. Although this has been a very basic tutorial you now have the capability to connect to your database and further develop your c# application to be able to perform CRUD operations. You could read and write data from a sensor and then have this output to a webpage graphically for example!

Please leave any comments if you need further clarification or examples.
